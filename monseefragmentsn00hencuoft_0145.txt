CONCLFSION.

l limit myself to a presentation of tho proofs of tho dia-
lect and age of the Mons. Frag.. and withhold tho consideration
of the dialect and ago of the original, and of the ‹letailed
correspondenees with [s. for an investigation„ which I am now
making on the relation of lsidor to the Mons. Frag.7 and
which was the indireet cause of this edition.

The Mons. Frag. are the remnants of a copy. the ori-

turals, a. Frankish characteristic, 3 times. The prefix ga
presents 2455» times the Bav. forms (ga, ka. gha. ¹trah)⁷ S times
Frank. forms (gi, ghi). 4 times the mixed form ki.

The consonant-system presents a mixture ‹›f Frankish
and Bavarian forms throughout. ln the ‹lental-row the Ba-

dialect. Germ. d is regularly mutated to t.. only (ί Rhine
