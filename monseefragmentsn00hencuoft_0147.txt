Early Rh. Frankish form of the 3 pers. prononn ir occurs but
once, the Bav. 01· appearing throughout. The Early Rh.
Frankish weak pret. of big-innan, bigunsta occurs once: also
the preterites with short e (gene, infenc. arhene) of the redup.
verbs gangan, antfahan and arhahan are characteristic of
Early Rh. Frankish. In the preterite and pret. part. of long
and polysyllabic stems of the wcak conjugation I. Frankish
forms with unsynfflpatffll i occur 44 times. Bavarian forms
without i 38 times. Also Early 111. Frankish are 1110 pre-
tcrites ‹lechhitut. 1011111111. strechita and sezzita of short 5101115
with Germ. k and t, Bavarian the forms kaquihta and arscricta
(cf. Beitr. VII, 14o Br. Grani. ς’ 2561).

The Early Rh. Frankish pret. hapta (tun) occurs four
times. the Bavarian habeta (etun) 3 times.

The mixture of Rhine Frankish and Bavarian exists
throughout the manuscript. although forms characteristic of
either dialect may be found in one part and not in another.
This is particularly true of the first part of the manuscript.
where the copyist is 1111051 10 1115 original.

The Rh. F rankish gh, dh and quh are found only on
the first pagos, while the Bavarian k for Germ. ,0- appears
only on pages 15-24 and 234—35. Also ga predominates
in one part, ka in another (V. Table).

Judging from the criteria of the language, the present
copy was made 501110 111110 during the first decades of the
ninth century. The diphthongs au and eo occur without
exception. The preservation of e of the original (ί times
beside ea occurring 69 times points 10 1110 first part of the
ninth century. The non-developement of a secondary vowel
before liquids and nasals after a long syllable is a charac-
teristic of the first half of the 11111111 century. H is preserved
before consonants with the exception of 11113105, where the
anlaut of the following· word (in uuales uuambu) may have
influenced the copyist. M is preserved in the cndings throughout.
The verbal prefix ar occurs with one doubtful exception.
Also a very important proof of the age of our copy is the
prcfix ga. The forms ga and ka, which were undoubtedly
introduced by the Bavarian copyist, occur 26ss timos with the
